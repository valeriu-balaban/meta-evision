COMMENT - https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/wandboard/fPf1fbEj9Io

From what I understand this functionality is only supported on official Yocto kernel recipes, none of which are used in Freescale community BSP.
Normally what I do is to create a new layer with a bbappend as Jakub mentions below.

I. Adding the evision layer to your build
=================================================

--- replace with specific instructions for the evision layer ---

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the evision layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the evision layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/yocto/meta \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-evision \
    "
